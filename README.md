# PowerCLI
Random PowerCLI for day to day management of my vSAN home lab.  Most of this code is influenced by many in the vCommunity.  

Alot of my code uses SecureString in Powershell.  If you are unfamiliar with how to make a encrytped credential, I used this site to learn how to do it: https://www.pdq.com/blog/secure-password-with-powershell-encrypting-credentials-part-1/
